<h1>Horror Movies that I Recommend to Watch</h1>
<h2>My top 3 horror movies.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Sleepy Hollow</h3>
<p>It captures the essence of Halloween, in a way that few can understand.</p>
<h3>Event Horizon</h3>
<p>If you like cosmic horror, you might wanna give it a try. I think even H.P Lovecraft would enjoy it.</p>
<h3>HÃ¤xan</h3>
<p>An old movie that encapsulates the fear of damnation and Hell, and what superstition can drive humans to do.</p>
